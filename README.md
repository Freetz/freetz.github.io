# Freetz wiki

This is a backup copy of the original Trac wiki on the old Freetz.org homepage.
It was imported into GitHub in order to provide a starting point for the project's
migration to GitHub.

You can browse the wiki as a set of [GitHub pages](https://freetz.github.io/). _(Sorry, they still
look like Trac pages due to the simple crawling approach used to create the copy.)_

The Freetz source code can be found in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/Freetz/freetz).

The extracted pages are not updated anymore. So anything in there is possibly outdated!
